## Hi! Welcome to my GitHub :)

My name is Shivangi Sirsiwal (she/her), I am a fourth year robotics engineering student at WPI. I love robots and I love coding them, so you'll find a lot of my projects are focused in that area.

I'm especially intereseted in multi-robot systems, manipulation robotics, and autonomus navigation, so feel free to reach out if you too are intereseted in these areas and want to chat, or if you have any questions regarding any of the projects on my profile.

Happy coding!
